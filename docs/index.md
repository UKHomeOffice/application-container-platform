# Application Container Platform

This page will give you an overview of ACP, the services it entails and the ways to get access to them. This is a general overview. Developers should check out the [Developer Docs](developer-docs/index.md).

The Application Container Platform provides an accredited, secure, scalable, reliable and performant hosting platform for Home Office applications.​

We use open source technology to allow delivery teams to develop, build, deploy and manage applications in a trusted environment. ​

We focus on enabling self-service where possible, and have developed a Platform Hub to act as a one stop shop for all things ACP, including support requests for things that aren't self serve (yet).

## Benefits of using ACP

* Reliance on specialist DevOps resource significantly reduced​
* Central place to host applications​
* Saves time for the projects​
* Significant hosting cost reduction​
* Common tools and patterns across projects i.e. CI​


**Everyone using our platform MUST adhere to [technical service standards](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/technical-service-requirements). All Services will be under a review process.**

For definitions on each phase of the lifecycle and the criteria for production-ready, please refer [here](service-lifecycle.md). Release notes for ACP services can be found [here](https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/acp-docs/acp-support/tree/master/release-notes).

## Accessing the Services
