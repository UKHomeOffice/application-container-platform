## **ACP External Addresses**

The ACP clusters all run behind NAT gateways, with fixed external addresses. Note, unless you've specifically choosen to run in a specific availability zone, your pods can run in any of the AZ's for that cluster, so all three addresses should be taken as the external ip's.
