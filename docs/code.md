# Code Management
## GitHub
Github is where we store our open source code. You need to be added to the Uk HomeOffice organisation to access most of our code. More documentation can be found [here](https://help.github.com/)
## Gitlab
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk) is where we store our more private code. Hosted in our ops cluster, you will need an office 365 account to get in via single sign on. Each project has its own group which are managed by members of that project. More in depth guides to gitlab can be found [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/README.html).
