# Service Lifecycle

This defines the current service lifecycle stages, this isn't specific to the hosting platform
and will no doubt move to somewhere more centric and referenced. However, this is a starting 
point to clearly communication the phases of our evolution. 

## Alpha

Alpha is an experimental phase to test the hypothesis, by building prototypes to validate
the direction and the intention of the service. It is there to explore ways of achieving and meeting
the user needs in the right way. 

There is more information on this [here](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/service-design-and-delivery-process/) and
[here](http://ausdto.github.io/service-handbook/alpha/1-introduction/1-1-what.html)

##Â Beta

This is the phase where software is more feature complete, it is aimed at being functional and meeting the definition
of a Minimal Viable Product, (MVP). The service is accessible and secured and meets a lot of the production requirements and needs,
however, there will be a assessment of the service through closed user groups; to evaluate that it meets the needs as expected.
SLA's and SLO's may differ from the user expectation of a live service and the availability expectation may not be to the standards
people would want of a live service. 

## Production

Once the product's have gone through the beta process, (which is to identify that the MVP is viable), the service will transition
into more of a production role. This means that it will have more rigour around the service, defined SLA's and SLO's to meet user
dependencies and expectations around the service. 

## What is the beta / production criteria.

To define what it means to be "production-ready", there is a set of criteria by which we assess services. This is not a concrete
list and is likely to evolve, however, it is something we make sure our platform services adhere to.

- Resilient (Recover from Restart)
- Highly available (Multiple Instances)
- Backups of all data
- Validation of backup, (not 0 file size)
- Restores of data tested
- CI Release process
- Continuous deployment (if needed) to prod, (done via CI)
- Is it independent of itself i.e. it doesn't rely on itself
- Tests defined and ran as part of CI process
- Monitoring of product
- Does it have an ATO?
- Monitoring Dashboards produced
- Alerting in place and tested
- Patching Process Defined + Tested
- Intrusion detection in place
- Security tested
- Does it log adequately?
- Logs persisted
- Non root user if docker is used
- Readonly root filesystem and hardening of container
- Documentation in place and standards
- Default Admin Password Changed
- Dev instance / playground
- SSO where needed
- Change Management process defined
- Incident Management process defined (incl agreed SLAs)
- Monitoring of cert expiry
