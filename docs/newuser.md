## Flow for new users
This document will go over the flow for getting access to our various services if you are finding difficulties with the specifics of the tasks outlined in this document please see the more detailed [Developer Docs][developer docs link].

## Office 365 Account
Licensed [Office 365](https://portal.office.com) accounts should be requested from your Programme Management Office. We can request AD-only accounts to facilitate access to ACP services via Single Sign On as explained on the [Support page](https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/acp-docs/acp-support)
Please note that to use SSO, which is using your Office 365 account to log onto other services, pop-ups will need to be enabled on your computer.

## VPN
VPN profiles are used to be able to get through to our multiple AWS environments as well as other data centers. The profiles can be downloaded from [access](https://access-acp.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk) which you can access using your Office 365 SSO. The following services can be only accessed when connected to the ACP Platform VPN profile.

## Platform Hub
[The Platform Hub](https://hub.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk) serves as a central portal for users of ACP. It acts as an all-in-one place to find information, requests and also support for the platform. The Hub also provides tools to develop, build, deploy and manage all your projects.

## Support Portal
All support requests, changes, incidents and announcements for ACP are managed via [JIRA Service Desk](https://support.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/servicedesk). A set of request templates have been created to cover a wide majority of general requests that users normally need. If your issue / request type is not listed, there is a [general request](https://support.acp.homeoffice.gov.uk/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/create/89) form available.
