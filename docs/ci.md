#CI
## Drone
Drone is our CI tool for building and deploying applications. We have two instances, one for [GitLab](https://drone-gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk) and one for [GitHub](https://drone.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk). More instructions can be found [here](../how-to-docs/drone-how-to.md).

## Jenkins
Jenkins is now considered a legacy system. Some projects still use it but all new projects will be expected to use drone.
