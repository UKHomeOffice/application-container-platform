# Platform Service Status

This provides a status of our overall services and where in the lifecycle they are in their evolution.
There are definitions that can be found for each of these to explain what we mean by production and what we mean
by Alpha and Beta. This is to help projects understand where the gaps might be on some of the services they might
want to consume and therefore assess the risk related to them.

For information on the service lifecycle definitions and the criteria of what we mark a production-ready service by, 
please refer to [here](docs/service_lifecycle.md)
