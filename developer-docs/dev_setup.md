# Developer Getting Started

## Pre-requisites
You should already have access to:

* Github, with membership of the UKHomeOffice org. This also grants access to:
* ukhomeofficedigital quay (login with your github account)
* Artifactory (login with Office 365)

## Introduction
This guide is aimed at developers that want to start using the platform to host their application.
You will need to:

1. [Request Access to the VPN and kubernetes](#requesting-access)
2. [Install the kubectl client](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/)
3. [Configure your kubectl client](#configure-the-kubectl-client)
4. [Test your setup](#testing-the-setup)

## Requesting Access
To connect to the platform you will need 2 accounts:

1. VPN access via Office 365
2. Kubernetes access token

Please request access by adding an issue to the Platform Access column [here](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/hosting-platform-bau/projects/1).

Please use the below template for your request

```
Please can I have VPN access for DSP Platform Dev, CI, Ops, and a kubernetes token with access to my teams namespaces.  
Email: xxx.xxx@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk  
Name: xxx xxx  
Team: My Project Team  
```
You also need to provide your public gpg key as the kube token you recieve back will be encyrpted using it.

## Configure the kubectl client
You will need to configure the kubectl client with the appropriate details.
We recommend copying the [example kubectl config](resources/kubeconfig) to ~/.kube/config. Note that you may need to create this directory and file.

The only change you will need to make is to replace "XXXXXXXXXX" with your kubernetes token.

## Testing the setup
Run:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
You should get an empty reply with just some column headers. The config file by default looks only at the *dev-induction* namespace. 
To look at other namespace you can, for example do:
```bash
kubectl --namespace=my-namespace get pods 
```
You can also edit your kubernetes config, either by editing the file directly or by running:
```
kubectl config
```
