# How to define a new RBAC policy

Visit and clone the [acp-kube repo][acp kube repo link] on GitLab.

Create a new branch for your new policy and use the README in the repo to help you write your new policy and determine the correct place for your policy.

Once you have created your new policy, push the new branch and create a pull request against master for it. You can ask someone to review your PR by posting it in the _#devops_ slack channel.
